# FlashCards Starter Kit

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

*Note that you will not need to you run your server until you are instantiating your `Game` class in Iteration 3. Prior to that, you should be using TDD to drive your code. You should check the functionality of your application by running your tests via `npm test`.*

## Challenges

 -Juggling multiple class files was a challenge at first, but started to feel more comfortable by the end.
 -Developing for terminal was an interesting new experience, one I would prefer not to repeat...


## Wins

 -I was please with how comfortable I felt creating the individual files and tests. Communicating between them was more challenging, but I felt I was able to manage it well by the end of the project.
 -I am still unsure if I am writing entirely great tests, but I did feel like writing the tests I did was a personal win.
